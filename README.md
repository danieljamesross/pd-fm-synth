# PureData FM Synth
A simple FM synth designed to run on a headerless [raspberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) running [PureData](https://puredata.info/)

It comes with a shell script that can be called at boot (I use crontab) so the patch can run, output audio, and be controlled via a USB MIDI device from power on.
